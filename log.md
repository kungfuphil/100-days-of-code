# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: December 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Followed along with a WPF/MVVM tutorial since that's what I'm trying to learn. Can't count this as a day because tutorials don't count. No worries, I have an idea of what to work on when I start.

**Thoughts:** The tutorial was pretty good. I think I got a basic grasp of almost everything. I was just confused about the CommandManager.RequerySuggested parts.

**Link to work:** n/a

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
