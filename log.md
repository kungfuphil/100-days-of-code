# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: December 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Followed along with a WPF/MVVM tutorial since that's what I'm trying to learn. Can't count this as a day because tutorials don't count. No worries, I have an idea of what to work on when I start.

**Thoughts:** The tutorial was pretty good. I think I got a basic grasp of almost everything. I was just confused about the CommandManager.RequerySuggested parts.

## Day 1: December 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Trying to build my own weather app using a different API than was used in the tutorial.

**Thoughts**: Following along is one thing, but making an app for yourself is another.

## Day 2: December 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Practiced by creating a simple WPF app using MVVM to create a movie database. Doesn't do much more than add movies at the moment, but it was good practice to remember all the steps to add the view, model, viewmodel, commands, and bindings.

**Thoughts**: I did peek a few times at the source material, though, so I'll probably have to do this again until I can do it without looking.

## Day 2.1: December 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent most of my time following a course. We're doing an Evernote clone. Still a few more modules to go before that's complete. Also tried out CodeWars for the first time.

**Thoughts**: Since this was mostly a training day, I can't count this as a new day. CodeWars seems like it could be something fun to do. Hoping to finish the Evernote clone lesson tomorrow and start practicing making a few things.

## Day 3: December 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: After several days of only coding at work and holiday-related things, I was finally able to put in an hour of coding outside of my normal work duties. Made a very small WPF app, trying to use MVVM principles, that counts my emails and deletes specific groups of ones that I don't need to read.

**Thoughts**: I'm not fully convinced this course that I was taking is going to be my best MVVM resource, but it did help me with the basics. I'm probably going to have to look for something else to supplement my understanding.

## Day 4: December 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Found a helpful Youtube video series on WPF and MVVM. Followed along and then updated my email tools app to use the Relay Command I just learned about. I was able to cut out several classes by using that. Also using the ObservableObject class reduced the amount of code I have to write as well.

**Thoughts**: Slow and steady wins the race, I guess. I was hoping to find one source of truth for this, but it seems like I will have to cobble together something from all the different bits I'm learning. This last video that I followed along with didn't tell me how to use the RelayCommand with a method that doesn't take parameters. Looking online it seems there's a way to do it with a DelegateCommand using PRISM. I'm going to have to look into that.

## Day 5: December 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent a good long while putting into practice all the things I learned about MVVM and WPF. Thank goodness I found those Youtube videos by Tosker. There were a great help. Things are starting to make a lot more sense now. Happy New Year everyone.

**Thoughts**: There are still things I need to learn, but I'm making pretty good progress.

## Day 6: June 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started the edX course Introduction to Functional Programming and finished chapter 2. There was a long gap between day 5 and 6 while I tried to make use of MVVM and WPF at work.

**Thoughts**: Functional programming feel different than object-oriented. I'm hoping that this will help me become a better developer. Although this course is mostly in Haskell, the ideas are supposed to be able to translate in many different languages.

## Day 7: June 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued a Node.js course that I never got around to finishing. I had to move back several lessons, but it's also helping me remember everything. Instead of trying to go through the whole course without stopping, I'm going to try to implement something similar after every major project to try and cement the lessons.

**Thoughts**: This seems to use a lot of functional programming with all the asynchronous calls and whatnot. I don't use this very much at the moment, but I can think of a few ways to incorporate it into my work.

### Day 8: June 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the weather app from [The Complete Node.js Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/). I researched additional information on how to hide API keys so that I wouldn't have them made available publicly. Next I'm working on using a different weather API to check the hourly weather (as far as I can go on the free plan) to see if the weather is good to go to the beach. Right now I'm just trying to get the logic working, but right now I'm not sure if I will try to implement this as a web page on Heroku or if I will be ambitious and deploy it to my Alexa.

**Thoughts**: Configuration can be a little complicated sometimes.

### Day 9: July 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on logic to check for "beach weather". Basically, I'm checking to see if it rains and what the temperature is during the time I might go to the beach. Right now all it does is use the OpenWeatherMapApi to check the hourly weather for the beach times (8am - 8pm) for the next 24 hours that the free version of the API gives me access to. I think I might integrate that logic into the weather app from the Node.js course.

**Thoughts**: Doing that Haskell course helped solidify some of these functional programming concepts I've com across with Javascript. I'm going to want to finish that sometime.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
