# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: December 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Followed along with a WPF/MVVM tutorial since that's what I'm trying to learn. Can't count this as a day because tutorials don't count. No worries, I have an idea of what to work on when I start.

**Thoughts:** The tutorial was pretty good. I think I got a basic grasp of almost everything. I was just confused about the CommandManager.RequerySuggested parts.

## Day 1: December 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Trying to build my own weather app using a different API than was used in the tutorial.

**Thoughts**: Following along is one thing, but making an app for yourself is another.

## Day 2: December 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Practiced by creating a simple WPF app using MVVM to create a movie database. Doesn't do much more than add movies at the moment, but it was good practice to remember all the steps to add the view, model, viewmodel, commands, and bindings.

**Thoughts**: I did peek a few times at the source material, though, so I'll probably have to do this again until I can do it without looking.

## Day 2.1: December 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent most of my time following a course. We're doing an Evernote clone. Still a few more modules to go before that's complete. Also tried out CodeWars for the first time.

**Thoughts**: Since this was mostly a training day, I can't count this as a new day. CodeWars seems like it could be something fun to do. Hoping to finish the Evernote clone lesson tomorrow and start practicing making a few things.

## Day 3: December 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: After several days of only coding at work and holiday-related things, I was finally able to put in an hour of coding outside of my normal work duties. Made a very small WPF app, trying to use MVVM principles, that counts my emails and deletes specific groups of ones that I don't need to read.

**Thoughts**: I'm not fully convinced this course that I was taking is going to be my best MVVM resource, but it did help me with the basics. I'm probably going to have to look for something else to supplement my understanding.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
